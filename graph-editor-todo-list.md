- [x] Add icons for different node types

### Step 2.3: Connection Logic
- [x] Implement connection validation in the graph schema
- [x] Create `FConnectionDrawingPolicy` subclass for HTN connections

- [x] Add visual feedback for valid/invalid connections

## Phase 3: Editor Integration 

### Step 3.1: Complete Asset Editor Registration
- [ ] Complete the implementation of `FAssetTypeActions_HTNGraph::OpenAssetEditor()`
- [ ] Register the `FHTNPlanAssetEditor` as the editor for HTN Graph assets
- [ ] Create proper editor initialization flow when opening an asset
- [ ] Test asset creation and editor opening in the Unreal Editor

### Step 3.2: Implement Editor UI Framework
- [ ] Connect the graph editor widget to the asset editor framework
- [ ] Implement proper tab layout and toolbar elements
- [ ] Add commands for common operations (compile, validate, save)
- [ ] Connect graph editor events to appropriate handlers

### Step 3.3: Implement Graph Context Menu
- [ ] Create context menu for adding new nodes to the graph
- [ ] Implement node-specific context menu options
- [ ] Add category organization for node types in context menu
- [ ] Connect context menu actions to node creation logic

## Phase 4: Node Details and Property Editing

### Step 4.1: Property Editing for Tasks
- [ ] Create custom property editors for task parameters
- [ ] Implement details customization for HTN nodes
- [ ] Create `FHTNGraphNodeDetails` class for the details panel
- [ ] Add support for editing task costs, descriptions, and other properties

### Step 4.2: Create Condition/Effect Nodes
- [ ] Create `UHTNGraphNode_Condition` class for preconditions
- [ ] Create `UHTNGraphNode_Effect` class for effects
- [ ] Implement property editing for conditions and effects
- [ ] Add visual feedback for conditions/effects on tasks

### Step 4.3: Method Organization
- [ ] Implement method selection interface for compound tasks
- [ ] Add priority editing for methods
- [ ] Create visual representation of method selection logic
- [ ] Add method description editing

## Phase 5: Graph Compilation and Runtime Integration

### Step 5.1: Graph Compilation System
- [ ] Create a `FHTNGraphCompiler` class to convert the visual graph to runtime objects
- [ ] Implement validation of the entire graph
- [ ] Add error reporting for invalid graphs
- [ ] Create debug visualization of the compilation process

### Step 5.2: Runtime Integration
- [ ] Extend `UHTNComponent` to support loading graphs from assets
- [ ] Create `UHTNGraphInstance` class for runtime use of compiled graphs
- [ ] Implement serialization between graph and runtime objects
- [ ] Add caching mechanism for compiled graphs

### Step 5.3: Debug and Visualization Tools
- [ ] Create runtime debugging view of executing graphs
- [ ] Implement visual feedback for the currently executing task
- [ ] Add breakpoints support for HTN graph execution
- [ ] Create graph validation tools to identify common mistakes

## Phase 6: User Experience Improvements

### Step 6.1: Node Templates and Library
- [ ] Create a node library panel for commonly used tasks
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop from library to graph
- [ ] Add template graphs as starting points
- [ ] Create documentation for graph usage

### Step 6.2: Graph Organization Tools
- [ ] Add comments and regions to graphs
- [ ] Implement auto-layout functionality
- [ ] Add node grouping features
- [ ] Create bookmarks for large graphs

### Step 6.3: Import the Test Case
- [ ] Create a graph asset that replicates the `CreateGetFoodPlan()` function
- [ ] Test execution through HTNComponent
- [ ] Compare results with code-based implementation
- [ ] Document the process for future reference

## Priorities and Approach

This checklist has been updated to prioritize the Editor Integration phase, which is now essential before moving on to more advanced features. This will allow you to create and open HTN graph assets in the Unreal Editor. Focus on completing Phase 3 next, as it will give you a functional editor that you can then enhance with the features in later phases.
